.SH EXAMPLE CRON JOB

Once \fBpodget\fP is running correctly, it's most useful if you run it from a cron job so that the new episodes are available to play or load onto a portable player and you don't have to wait for them to download.
.PP
To edit your crontab, do:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
  $ crontab \-e

.fam T
.fi
Then insert one line (i for insert mode), like the following:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
  15 04 * * * /usr/bin/podget \-s

.fam T
.fi
This will run \fBpodget\fP at 4:15 AM every day.
.SH AUTOMATIC CLEANUP

You can enable automatic cleanup with every run by configuring it in your $HOME/.\fBpodget\fP/podgetrc file. Simply set the following options:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
  # Autocleanup.
  # 0 == disabled
  # 1 == delete any old content
  cleanup=1

  # Number of days to keep files.   Cleanup will remove anything
  # older than this.
  cleanup_days=7

.fam T
.fi
However, some people prefer to run cleanup as a separate cron session. To do that, set the options in podgetrc to:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
  # Autocleanup.
  # 0 == disabled
  # 1 == delete any old content
  cleanup=0

  # Number of days to keep files.   Cleanup will remove anything
  # older than this.
  cleanup_days=7

.fam T
.fi
And add a cron job to run cleanup, like one of these examples:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
  # Once a week on Sunday at 04:15AM
  15 04 * * Sun /usr/bin/podget \-C

.fam T
.fi
.SH SESSION CONTROL

Podget checks for already running sessions when it starts and exits if any are found. Each session requires its own core configuration file, so for multiple sessions simply provide a unique \fB-c\fP <configfile> option for each.
.SH EXAMPLE SERVER LIST

By default, Podget uses $HOME/.\fBpodget\fP/serverlist for the default list of servers to contact. However you can configure the name with the config_serverlist variable in your $HOME/.\fBpodget\fP/podgetrc file.
.PP
The default format is: <url> <category> <name>

HANDLING UTF-16 FEEDS
.PP
Some servers provide their feeds in UTF-16 format rather than the more common UTF-8.
.PP
To automatically convert these files, create a secondary serverlist at:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
        $HOME/.podget/serverlist.utf16

.fam T
.fi
Remember to change the name of the serverlist to match what you set it to with config_serverlist if you changed it.
