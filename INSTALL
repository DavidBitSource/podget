Source Install:
     $ make
     $ sudo make install

    After the package is installed, run it once to install
    default configuration files into $HOME/.podget, edit
    them as needed.

Building and installing a Debian package:
     $ cd podget-<version>
     $ fakeroot ./debian/rules binary
     $ cd ../
     $ sudo dpkg -i podget_<version>-all.deb

Mac OSX GNU Dependencies:
    Podget requires GNU Sed and Coreutils (for expr).  The easiest way to
    install them is to use Homebrew.  For details on how to install and
    use Homebrew, please visit: https://brew.sh

    GNU Sed can be installed with: brew install gnu-sed

    And Coreutils can be installed with: brew install coreutils.

    Podget looks for the required binaries with a 'g' prefix.  This prefix is
    added automatically by brew with its default options.  The prefix can be
    overridden with the brew option '--with-default-names'.  However if you do
    this, it may be necessary that you add symbolic links from the brew
    installed sed to gsed and from the brew installed expr to gexpr.
