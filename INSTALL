Source Install:
     $ make
     $ sudo make install

    After the package is installed, run it once to install
    default configuration files into $HOME/.podget, edit
    them as needed.

Building and installing a Debian package:
     $ cd podget-<version>
     $ fakeroot ./debian/rules binary
     $ cd ../
     $ sudo dpkg -i podget_<version>-all.deb

Mac OSX GNU Sed Dependency:
    Podget requires GNU Sed.  The easiest way to install this is
    to use Homebrew.  For details on how to install and use
    Homebrew, please visit: https://brew.sh

    Once Homebrew is installed, GNU Sed can be installed
    with: brew install gnu-sed
